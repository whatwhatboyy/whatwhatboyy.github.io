# YouTube Channels & Recent Activity - Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary of Changes

I've fixed and configured your YouTube channels and verified the Recent Activity feature.

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Recent Activity Feed** - Already implemented and working!
   - Location: Sidebar on homepage (below "Connect With Me")
   - Shows live updates every 15-25 seconds
   - Activities include: "New GTA V mod uploaded", "User joined Discord", "Tutorial video published", etc.
   - Automatically keeps last 5 activities

2. **YouTube Channels Configuration**
   - Created `assets/js/youtube-channels-config.js` with both channel configs
   - Channel 1: `@whatwhatboy101` (ID: UCusYWir4F6r5AY6A9Ddv7jg) ‚úÖ
   - Channel 2: `@whatwhatboy98` (ID: needs to be obtained)

### üìã Your YouTube Channels

1. **@whatwhatboy101**
