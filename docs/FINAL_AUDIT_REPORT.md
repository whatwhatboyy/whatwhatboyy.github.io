## ℹ️ Remaining Items (Not Issues)

### Imgur Links in Individual Game Pages
**Status**: ✅ Intentional
**Count**: 63 links
**Purpose**: Screenshot images for individual cheats
**Action**: None needed - these are cheat screenshots, not game covers

**Example**:
- `<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rhinomw2.png" alt="Rhino MW2">`
- These are cheat interface screenshots embedded in game pages
- Different from game cover art (which has been fixed)

### Individual Game Page Enhancements
